# SVG Icons

SVGs are the default and recommended file format for your icons. Add these to the root of your `iconSets` folder, or create folders to group multiple SVGs with.

With Icon Picker, you can access the name of the SVG picked, or even get the raw SVG content to output inline. For more information, see the [Template Guide](docs:template-guides/rendering-icons)

You can also use [SVG Sprites](docs:feature-tour/svg-icons) instead of, or an addition to single SVGs.
