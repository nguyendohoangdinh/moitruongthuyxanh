# Icon Fonts

Given a provided web-font file, Icon Picker will allow you to select specific characters in the font for use on your site. These are 'glyphs', and while slightly more complicated to output in your templates, could very well suit your workflow for your site. You'll have access to the glyph's name, or raw unicode glyph character.

Icon Picker supports `*.tff`, `*.woff`, `*.woff2` and `*.oft` files. They should be placed in the root of your `iconSetsPath` folder.
